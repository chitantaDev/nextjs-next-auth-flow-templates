TODO:
Document the templates setup:
- all npm packages
- sql creation script
- database structure diagram
- auth workflow
- directory structure intro
- enviroment variables / .env* setup
- google smtp server setup: create account -> 2FA -> App Password -> create App + password -> paste into env
- Database file location - Where SQLite file gets created
- Database initialization - How to create the database file and run the SQL script
- NextAuth configuration - Secret generation, URL setup
- Node.js, Nextjs, NextAuth version requirements - Which version you used/recommend
- Secret generation



Features: 
- Delete Account functionality (button in header)
- 2 Pages, Home Page and Dummy Page to have back and forth navigation with buttons or something
- Registration needs 2 password fields so u can check if u misstyped
- clean up global.css and maybe put the styles into the directories of the components / pages

Quality of Life improvments (necessities)
- sanitize SQL Statements to protect from SQLInjections
- rate limit access to my backend api routes 
- think about component and page structure, shared-ui, core components, shared-components (dumb components) and specific 
smart components for its one specific use case in one component or page
- repository, controller, service setup and directory structure: its easy and nice to have SQL statements where u need them
but when I scale the template into a product, this will get too messy

Where to depoy? Nextjs free vercel deployment eventho i have a backend? is the backend lightweight enough so i dont 
have to rent a server like for a java spring app, can i host for free? sqlite3 so i dont need a db server

# Claude Sonnet AI Feedback on what TODOS to add to my list:

## Security & Production Readiness
- **Environment validation** - Ensure all required env vars are present on startup
- **HTTPS enforcement** - Redirect HTTP to HTTPS in production
- **Secure headers** - Add security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- **Password strength validation** - Min 8 chars, special chars, etc.
- **Account lockout** - Lock accounts after failed login attempts
- 
## Error Handling & Monitoring
- **Global error boundary** - Catch and handle React errors gracefully
- **API error standardization** - Consistent error response format
- **Logging system** - Structured logging for debugging production issues
- **Health check endpoint** - `/api/health` for monitoring

## User Experience
- **Loading states** - Proper loading indicators for all async operations
- **Form validation** - Client-side validation with proper error messages
- **Toast notifications** - Success/error messages instead of alerts
- **Responsive design** - Mobile-first approach
- **Accessibility** - ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

## Database & Performance
- **Database migrations** - Version control for schema changes
- **Connection pooling** - Proper database connection management
- **Backup strategy** - Automated database backups
- **Database indexes optimization** - Review and optimize all queries

## DevOps & Deployment
- **Docker containerization** - For consistent deployments
- **CI/CD pipeline** - Automated testing and deployment
- **Environment configs** - Dev/staging/prod environment separation
- **Database seeding** - Scripts for initial data setup

## Legal & Compliance
- **Privacy policy** - GDPR/CCPA compliance if needed
- **Terms of service** - User agreement
- **Cookie consent** - If using tracking cookies
- **Data retention policy** - How long to keep user data

# GDPR Concenrs (EU Laws / German Laws I have to adhere to when creating a website)

# EU Compliance for One-Man SaaS (Build Fast Ship Fast)

## GDPR Essentials (Can't Skip)
- **Privacy Policy** - Simple template from a generator (30 mins)
- **Data collection notice** - "We collect email/username for account creation"
- **Right to deletion** - Your delete account feature covers this ✅
- **Data breach notification** - If you get hacked, notify users within 72 hours

## Cookies (Simple Fix)
- **If you're ONLY using NextAuth session cookies** - No banner needed (essential cookies)
- **If you add Google Analytics later** - Then you need a cookie banner
- **For now** - Skip the cookie banner, you're good

## Password Storage (You're Already Compliant)
- **bcrypt hashing** ✅ - You're already doing this correctly
- **No plain text storage** ✅ - You hash immediately

## Terms of Service
- **Basic template** - "Don't abuse the service, we can terminate accounts"
- **Liability disclaimer** - "Service provided as-is"

## What You DON'T Need (Build Fast Mode)
- ❌ Cookie consent banners (unless tracking users)
- ❌ Complex data processing agreements
- ❌ GDPR officer appointment (under 250 employees)
- ❌ Data protection impact assessments
- ❌ Detailed audit logs

## Quick Implementation (1 day max)
1. **Privacy policy generator** - Use a free template
2. **Terms generator** - Use a free template
3. **Add links in footer** - Privacy | Terms
4. **Delete account button** - You already planned this

**That's it!** You're 95% compliant with minimal effort. Launch first, optimize compliance later when you have revenue.
